# Vaibhav Singh's Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! This repository is a curated collection of projects that demonstrate my journey and proficiency in transforming raw data into meaningful and actionable insights. Each assignment showcases a different facet of my analytical skillset, from foundational data manipulation in Excel to creating complex, interactive dashboards in Power BI and Tableau, and querying relational databases with SQL.

This collection is not just about finding answers; it's about telling a story with data and building the tools that empower decision-making.

## üöÄ Detailed Assignment Breakdown

Here is a comprehensive look at what each project entails:

### üìÅ 1. Advanced Excel Analysis

This project demonstrates a bottom-up mastery of Excel for data analysis, progressing from core functions to the creation of a fully interactive dashboard.

* **Core Functions (`Q1` - `Q4`):** Executed a range of arithmetic, logical, lookup, and date functions to clean, transform, and analyze employee and sales data. This section showcases the foundational skills required for any data manipulation task.
* **Data Organization (`Q5`):** Applied multi-level custom sorting and advanced filtering techniques to isolate specific data subsets, such as identifying sales performance in Q3 or for countries starting with the letter "F."
* **Visualization & Dashboarding (`Q6` - `Q7`):** Developed a dynamic dashboard from a raw sales dataset. This involved:
    * **ETL with Power Query:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data from multiple sources.
    * **Data Modeling with Power Pivot:** Building relationships between `Orders`, `Returns`, and `Users` tables to create a unified data model.
    * **Insight Generation:** Creating Pivot Tables and Charts to uncover key business metrics like the most-used shipment modes, top 5 profitable states, and underperforming product categories.
    * **Interactivity:** Implementing Slicers and Timelines to allow for fluid, user-driven exploration of the data.
* **Automation (`Q8`):** Utilized VBA and Macros to automate repetitive tasks, demonstrating an understanding of efficiency and process improvement.

### üìÅ 2. Power BI Financial Dashboard

This project showcases the ability to build a comprehensive and interactive financial dashboard from the ground up, focusing on visualization best practices and DAX for complex calculations.

* **Dataset:** Utilized a finance dataset containing sales, discounts, manufacturing costs, and profits across various segments, countries, and products.
* **Dashboard Development:** The `.pbix` file contains a complete, multi-page report that addresses key business questions through:
    * **DAX Measures:** Created calculated columns and measures to analyze year-over-year growth and other KPIs.
    * **Interactive Visuals:** Employed a variety of charts (donut, clustered column, waterfall) and features like bookmarks and drill-throughs to allow for deep-dive analysis.
    * **Conditional Formatting:** Applied dynamic formatting rules to tables to instantly highlight performance (e.g., green for positive profit, red for negative).
    * **UI/UX:** Designed a user-friendly dashboard with clear navigation, slicers, and informative cards for at-a-glance understanding.

### üìÅ 3. MySQL Database Querying & Analysis

This project demonstrates proficiency in SQL for extracting and manipulating data from the `classicmodels` relational database, a simulation of a B2B car models retailer.

* **Database Schema:** The `classicmodels database.sql` script provides the complete database structure.
* **SQL Solutions (`Vaibhav_Singh_MySql_Assignment_Solution.sql`):** This script contains the solutions to a wide array of SQL challenges, including:
    * **Advanced `SELECT` Queries:** Using `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses to filter and aggregate data.
    * **Customer Segmentation:** Applying `CASE` statements to categorize customers based on their geographical location.
    * **Time Series Analysis:** Using date functions to analyze order patterns over time.
    * **Ranking and Comparison:** Employing window functions (`RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `LEAD`, `LAG`) to rank customers and calculate year-over-year changes.
    * **Database Programming:** Creating stored procedures with error handling (`Emp_EH`) and triggers (`Emp_BIT`) to enforce data integrity.

### üìÅ 4. Tableau Visual Storytelling with Netflix Data

This project focuses on data visualization and dashboarding using Tableau to explore trends within the Netflix content library.

* **Dataset:** A normalized dataset consisting of multiple CSV files detailing Netflix shows, directors, cast, countries, and categories.
* **Tableau Workbook (`.twbx`):** The packaged workbook is a complete analytical solution that demonstrates the ability to:
    * **Combine Data:** Merge and join disparate data sources to create a unified view.
    * **Perform Analysis:** Identify the actor with the most appearances in "Sports Movies."
    * **Create Advanced Visuals:** Build histograms to show the distribution of customer order frequency and pie charts using Sets to compare Top 50 customers vs. others.
    * **Develop KPIs:** Design custom KPI cards with calculated fields to show profit growth with visual indicators (up/down arrows).
    * **Build Interactive Dashboards:** Create a dynamic and filterable dashboard that allows users to explore data by different metrics, regions, and years.
